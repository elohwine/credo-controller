## Resolving and accepting a credential offer[​](https://credo.js.org/guides/tutorials/openid4vc/receiving-and-proving-credentials-using-openid4vc-holder-module#resolving-and-accepting-a-credential-offer)

Once you have set-up your agent (under holder variable), and have a credential offer (either created using the issuer module, or an external OpenID4VC issuer), we can resolve and accept the credential offer.

```
holder
```

The credentialBindingResolver is a method you need to provide that configures how the credential should be bound to the wallet. The implemented binding resolver in this tutorial first checks if the issuer supports did:key and will use that. Otherwise it will check if jwk is supported.

```
credentialBindingResolver
```


```
did:key
```

Finally the credentials are stored using the SD JWT VC and W3C modules. In a wallet application you could choose to first show the credential to the user before storing it in the wallet.

## Resolving and accepting an authorization request (presentation request)[​](https://credo.js.org/guides/tutorials/openid4vc/receiving-and-proving-credentials-using-openid4vc-holder-module#resolving-and-accepting-an-authorization-request-presentation-request)

Once you have a credential in your wallet, you can start presenting it based on a receive authorization request including an OpenID4VP presentation request (either created using the verifier module, or an external OpenID4VC verifier). First we resolve the authorization request, and then we accept it and present the credential in our wallet.
